Hi, I'm Utkarsh 👋

I build B2B marketplace products and ship solutions that scale across emerging markets.

Most of my work is hands-on: product strategy, platform architecture, and tested frameworks for fintech, payments, and multi-vendor marketplaces processing £1B+ annually.
I share practical templates, product frameworks, and AI-powered tools at https://github.com/utkarsh2305?tab=repositories.
